1Ba User Interfaces project 

This is a simple web site made for a fictional moving company as a school project. It was built as an assignment for the User Interfaces course in the first bachelor year applied informatics at Karel de Grote University College. 

## Technology 
The assignment was to only use vanilla HTML5 and CSS3. No server environment is needed: you should be able to use the website by just opening it in a web browser.
